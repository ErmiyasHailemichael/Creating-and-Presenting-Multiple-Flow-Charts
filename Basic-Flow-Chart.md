### Explain basic flow chart

This basic flow chart illustrates the website's primary user journey for inquiring about a business room rental. It begins with the user landing on the homepage, browsing available rooms, viewing details of a selected room, filling out an inquiry form, and finally submitting that form to receive a confirmation message. 

I chose the Basic Flow Chart format for this process because it provides a high-level, easy-to-follow visualization of the room inquiry process without technical details. I faced the challenge of using luicd since it was my first time using it.
