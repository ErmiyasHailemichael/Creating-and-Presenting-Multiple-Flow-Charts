### Explanation: Swimlane Flow Chart – Task Responsibilities Across Roles

This Swimlane Flow Chart visualizes how tasks are distributed among the key stakeholders involved in developing and managing the Rental Business website: the **Owner**, **Developer**, and **User**. Each swimlane clearly shows the responsibilities of each role across different phases—from planning and design to deployment and feedback. 

The swimlane format was chosen because it offers a **clear breakdown of responsibility**, making it easy to identify who is doing what and when. This helps avoid confusion, reduces role overlap, and supports smoother collaboration. A key insight from this chart is that even a simple project requires ongoing collaboration and feedback loops between all parties.
